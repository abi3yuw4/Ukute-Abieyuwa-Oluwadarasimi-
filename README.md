# Library Management System (LMS)
## Course: Software Engineering (SEN)
## Project Description
The Library Management System (LMS) is a simple console-based application developed as part of the Software Engineering (SEN) assignment.  
The system is designed to manage library operations such as adding books, registering members, borrowing books, and returning books.  
It follows the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from requirement analysis to maintenance.

- Register library members
- Borrow books
- Return borrowed books
- Display all books and their availability status

---

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Development Environment: Any Python-supported IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Version Control: **GitHub**

---

## System Design
The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

### Classes Used
